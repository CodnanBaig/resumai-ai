# ResumeAI Project Status Report

**Date:** August 29, 2025

## Overview

ResumeAI is a Next.js web application designed to help users create professional resumes and cover letters with AI-powered enhancements. The application includes user authentication, document creation and management, and data persistence using a database.

## Current Status

The project is currently in the **mid-to-late development phase**. Core functionalities like user authentication, basic resume and cover letter management, and a working dashboard are implemented. The recent migration to MySQL as the primary database for both development (via Docker) and production is a significant milestone.

## Completed Work

All tasks listed under the "Completed" section in `TASKS.md` have been finished. These include:
- Setting up Prisma ORM with SQLite and defining the initial schema for `User`, `Resume`, and `CoverLetter`.
- Implementing JWT-based user authentication (registration, login, logout) with password hashing.
- Protecting API routes and pages using middleware.
- Replacing mock API endpoints with database-backed implementations for users, resumes, and cover letters.
- Creating essential dashboard APIs to fetch user statistics and documents.
- Implementing basic CRUD APIs for resumes and cover letters.
- Configuring Tailwind CSS for styling.

## In Progress

The tasks related to database migration have been successfully completed. The application now uses MySQL via Docker for local development, aligning with the goal for production. The Prisma schema and migrations have been updated accordingly.

The task "Wire AI endpoints to use stored resumes when applicable" is still in progress.

## Upcoming Tasks (Prioritized)

1.  **Environment Configuration:**
    - Finalize `.env.production` with the production MySQL URL.
2.  **Data Management:**
    - Define a strategy for data backups and migration from local development to production.
    - Add an `Activity` model to track user actions.
3.  **Feature Enhancement:**
    - Implement dedicated update endpoints for resumes and cover letters (if not fully covered by existing PUTs).
    - Integrate real PDF generation using `@react-pdf/renderer` or Puppeteer.
    - Implement secure parsing and mapping of uploaded resume files to data fields.
4.  **Security Improvements:**
    - Implement a refresh token strategy for more secure, short-lived JWT sessions.
5.  **Scalability & Access Control:**
    - Plan for Role-based access (future consideration).
6.  **Quality Assurance:**
    - Develop and execute unit, API, and E2E tests.
7.  **Deployment:**
    - Finalize deployment configuration and secrets management.

## Overall Progress

Based on the tasks outlined in `TASKS.md` and the work completed, the project is estimated to be approximately **60-65% complete** towards a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The core architecture is solid, and the primary user flows are implemented. The focus is now shifting towards enhancing features, improving security, and ensuring quality through testing before final deployment.
